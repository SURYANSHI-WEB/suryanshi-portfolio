# 🌿 Suryanshi's Portfolio

Hi! I'm Suryanshi 👋  
This is my personal portfolio website built from scratch using HTML and CSS.

It reflects who I am as a Full Stack Developer in progress. Someone who enjoys building complete applications, refining UI details, and continuously improving technical depth.

## 📘 What I Learned Building This

Building this portfolio helped me strengthen more than just my HTML and CSS skills. It taught me:

- How to structure a website using semantic HTML  
- How to design clean and responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid  
- The importance of spacing, alignment, and visual consistency  
- How to debug layout issues and refine UI details  
- How to connect a static form to a real service (Formspree)  
- How to version control and deploy projects using Git & GitHub  

Most importantly, it helped me understand that writing clean, organized code is just as important as making something look good.
